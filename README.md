Preparation - Flask API

Based initially in:

    Python REST APIs With Flask, Connexion, and SQLAlchemy
- https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api/
- https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api-part-2/
- https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api-part-3/

After:

    Build a JavaScript Front End for a Flask API
- https://realpython.com/flask-javascript-frontend-for-rest-api/

Finally, a look back at the foundation of VueJS 3 with a Vue Mastery video:

    The best way to learn Vue.js in 2023 - CRASH COURSE
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzlFvd0b65c

and, in the route `/vue`, rebuild all SPA functionality using Vue3 and Axios. Apart from the functionality present in the "debug-card".

After that, reviewing the basic documentation (Docs - Guide) in

- https://vuejs.org/

in the `/vuemod` route, I replicate all the functionalities in `/vue`, but using script type module. This is less compatible with slightly older browsers, but provides cleaner code.
